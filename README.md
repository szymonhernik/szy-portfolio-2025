to do:

- see if changing the ItemModal to a dialog is better (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/dialog_role)
- decide if you want to have a static route for each garden item /garden/[id]
- fix the modal and the static route for the garden list /garden
- add breadcrumbs to the garden list page (in modal navigate between garden and items)
