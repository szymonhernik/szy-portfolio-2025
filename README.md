# to do:

### General

- [ ] the SZY element moves outside of the viewport -> work on the calculation

### Garden

- [x] see if changing the ItemModal to a dialog is better (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/dialog_role) -> sticking with rendering into a single div for now
- [x] decide if you want to have a static route for each garden item /garden/[id]
- [x] add breadcrumbs to the garden list page (in modal navigate between garden and items)
- [x] fix the modal and the static route for the garden list /garden
- [ ] design the garden item page (with images and videos)

---

### Carousels

- [x] style full page carousel
- [ ] in sanity, add a mobile alternative for video and image types
- [x] add captions in the full page carousel

---

### Project page

- [ ] render categories as links to the filters page
